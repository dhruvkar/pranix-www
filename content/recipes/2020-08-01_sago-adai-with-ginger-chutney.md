Health Benefits of Ginger:

Apart from adding a much-needed pungent zing to your dishes, ginger has been used since ancient times for its various medicinal properties. Ginger is known to help reduce gas and nausea, improve digestion, ease a cold or the flu, and even reduce exercise-induced muscle pain and inflammation. There is more – some studies have shown that ginger may even improve brain function, lower cholesterol levels, and significantly reduce menstrual pain. It is no wonder that it is one of the most popular home remedies!
