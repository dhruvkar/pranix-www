For the coriander chutney:

1 small piece of ginger

1 to 5 red chilies (to taste)

2 tsps. oil

Salt (to taste)

 

For the seasoning:

1 tsp. oil

1 tsp. mustard

1 red chili

Method

For the tomato sauce:

1) Heat oil in a skillet.

2) Add the tomatoes along with salt, chili powder, pepper powder, and cumin powder, and fry till they turn mushy.

3) Allow it to cool. Once it has cooled, put everything into a mixer jar.

4) Add a little sugar and grind until smooth. The tomato sauce is ready. Transfer the sauce into a bowl.


For the wheat pizza paratha:

1) Mix wheat flour, salt, and oil into a bowl, and whisk together. Gradually add a little water to form a firm dough.

2) Cover the dough with a clean cloth for about 20 minutes.

3) Take some dough and flatten it to make a round or square shaped chapati (flat bread). Make another chapati of the same size and set aside.

4) Spread 1 tbsp. of tomato sauce over the first chapati. Leave about ½ inch around the edges as is.

5) Sprinkle the grated cheese, finely chopped tomatoes, capsicum sliced lengthwise, and grated paneer on top. 

6) Now place the second chapati on top of this mixture and lightly press the edges together with a spoon to seal them.

7) Heat a frying pan (tava). Once it’s hot, place the paratha in the pan and cook both sides until golden brown spots appear.

8) Serve with the remaining tomato sauce and coriander chutney.

 

For the coriander chutney:

1) Heat oil in a pan and add the urad dal. Fry until it gains a golden color.

2) Add chilies, coriander leaves, ginger, tamarind, and fry for 2 to 3 minutes.

3) Now add the grated coconut, give it a toss, and then switch off the stove immediately.

4) Allow it to cool.
