Pearl Millet Flatbreads (Bajra Roti)
**INGREDIENTS**

- 1 cup pearl millet (bajra) flour, plus a few more tablespoons for kneading
- ½ teaspoon pepper
- 1 teaspoon coriander powder
- ½ teaspoon cumin powder
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Ghee (clarified butter)

**METHOD**

1. In a large bowl, mix one cup of pearl millet flour with pepper, turmeric, cumin, and coriander powder.
2. In a saucepan, add salt to one cup of water and bring it to a boil.
3. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and add in the pearl millet flour.
4. Cover with a lid and let it simmer for one minute.
5. Turn off the heat and mix the pearl millet flour and water thoroughly using a wooden spatula.
6. Let the resulting dough cool down completely to room temperature.
7. Moisten your palms with a few drops of oil before handling the pearl millet dough, as it can be quite sticky.
8. Take the dough out of the saucepan and onto a flat surface that has been dusted with dry pearl millet flour.
9. Knead the dough very well for at least 5–8 minutes. This step is important to ensure that the rotis (thin flatbreads) are soft and will not break apart while shaping.
10. Break off a small part of the dough, roll it into a ball and flatten it between your palms.
11. If the dough gets too sticky to form flat, round rotis, sprinkle it with some pearl millet flour.
12. Put a little bit of ghee to a cast iron skillet on a medium flame, then add the roti and cook it for about two minutes on each side. While cooking, add more ghee if needed.
13. As you make more rotis, ensure to knead each individual dough ball before shaping. This will ensure that the rotis are soft and the dough is malleable enough to work with.
