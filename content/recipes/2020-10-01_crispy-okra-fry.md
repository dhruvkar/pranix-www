Ingredients

2 ½ cups okra (ladies’ fingers/bhindi) 

¼ cup gram flour (chickpea flour/besan)

1 tsp. rice flour 

1 tsp. chili powder

½ tsp. turmeric powder 

½ tsp. cumin powder

1 tsp. pepper powder 

Oil (as needed)

Salt (to taste)

Method

1) Wash the okra (bhindi) thoroughly and wipe completely dry with a kitchen napkin. 

2) Remove the crown and tip of the okra. Then slice it in half lengthwise (like long chips) and remove the insides including the seeds. 

3) In a bowl, add the sliced okras, chili powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, pepper powder, and salt. Then add the gram flour and rice flour and mix well.

4) Let the mixture marinate for 10–15 minutes.

5) If frying, heat oil in a pan. Drop the coated okras in hot oil, then keep the heat on a medium flame until evenly fried to a golden-brown color and crisp. Place the fried okra on an absorbent paper towel to remove excess oil. 

6) If baking, spread the marinated okra on a greased tray. Brush some oil on top of the okra. Bake in a preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius until crisp and golden.

7) The crispy okra fry (bhindi pakoda) is ready to serve!
